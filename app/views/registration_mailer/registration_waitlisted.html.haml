    %strong A note about pairs:
    This league allows players to pair up to guarantee that they will be on the same team. The only way to ensure that your pair
    request will be respected is if you <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yT_TgUjLfcgKBY-uCQD5xmwqL7vowbdOHhAM6Xy0J50/edit">use the official pairing system</a>.
    Requests made to the commissioner or in the notes field of your registration cannot be guaranteed.
