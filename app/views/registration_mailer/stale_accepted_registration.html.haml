  In #{time_left}, you will lose your spot for #{link_to(@league.name, league_url(@league))}. This would be a tragedy. But don't worry,
  all is not yet lost! All you have to do is log back in to the leagues site and pay!

    %strong A note about pairs:
    This league allows players to pair up to guarantee that they will be on the same team. The only way to ensure that your pair
    request will be respected is if you <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yT_TgUjLfcgKBY-uCQD5xmwqL7vowbdOHhAM6Xy0J50/edit">use the official pairing system</a>.
    Requests made to the commissioner or in the notes field of your registration cannot be guaranteed.
